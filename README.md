Dewblock Demo App as Proof of Concept

Title**: Implementation of Dewblock Clients on Mobile Platform.

Backgroud: Blockchain is currently an important emerging technology. In general, blockchain was developed in order to digital secure transactions. It was first introduced as part of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Despite being pioneered for digital transactions security, it is not limited to that. As a decentralized distributed ledger technology, blockchain has many applications such as securely storing patient’s information, maintaining supply chain integrity, asset management, claim processing, etc. 

However, as a result of blockchain’s design, each node in the blockchain system must continuously send and receive data as well as maintaining a complete record of the blockchain data. As a result, data requirements for a node can exceed the capabilities of some devices, limiting its applicability to applications for mobile phones, tablets and personal laptops. In this project, a mobile application is developed as a Proof Of Concept(POC), which implements a special kind of blockchain architecture allowing it to run on any android mobile phone or tablet, without the same storage limitations. This architecture, named Dewblock, uses the principles of Dew Computing and cloud-dew architecture, emerging technologies extending the principles of Cloud Computing.

The main intension of this project was to implement Dewblock on a Mobile Platform. Thus the proposed dewblock architecture is proved to be used. To kept that in mind, A Hybrid Android Application was developed successfully which we named "dewblockApp".
